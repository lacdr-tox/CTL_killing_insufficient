# CTL_killing_insufficient

Code needed to reproduce results in: Beck, Richard J., Maarten Slagter, and Joost B. Beltman. "Contact-dependent killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes is insufficient for EL4 tumor regression in vivo." Cancer research 79.13 (2019): 3406-3416. Data from: Breart, BÃ©atrice, et al. "Two-photon imaging of intratumoral CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity during adoptive T cell therapy in mice." The Journal of clinical investigation 118.4 (2008): 1390-1397, was used to generate statistics about CTL killing perfromance, tumour infiltration and tumour control in a murine model. Ordinary differential equation and agent based models were used to describe the CTL-tumour interaction and test whether the measured killing performance of the CTLs was sufficient to explain tumour control in that experimental setting.

Markdown scripts in figure_scripts folder can be used to reproduce figures.
